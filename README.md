## Development Journey and Learning Experience

#### Building from Scratch with Pure CSS

In this project, I've crafted all the components from scratch without relying on any UI library. The use of pure CSS adds a touch of customization and uniqueness to the design.

#### Embracing New Technologies

Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges and embraced opportunities to learn new technologies. Notably, diving into [React-Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) posed exciting learning curves. Despite being new to these tools, the experience was both enriching and enjoyable.

#### Thank You Blitz!
